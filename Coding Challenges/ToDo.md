- What is Data Structures
- What is Algorithms
- Time Complexity and Space Complexity
    - Common Algorithms that have said complexity (DFS, backtracking, etc)
- Different types of Data Structures (& their associated algorithms):
    - Arrays / 2D arrays
    - Queue / Stack
    - Set / Hashmap
    - String
    - Linked List
    - Heap / Priority Queue
    - Trees:
        - Trie
        - Segment Tree
    - Graphs

- Different Types of Algorithms - (& how to spot them):
    - 2 Pointers
    - Running Pointers
    - Binary Search
    - Sliding Window
    - DFS (iterative, InOrder, inOrder iterative, PreOrder, postOrder)
    - BFS
    - TopSort
    - Backtracking (Find all possible solution)
    - Prefix Sum
    - interval 
    - Greedy (Optimization Problem - we have a predefined method of selecting a given edge (i.e. always pick the minimum edge) - find the max or min of something)
        - Dijkstra
        - Disjoint Set Union
        - Minimum Spanning Tree
            - Prims
            - Kruskals
    - Dynamic Programming: (Optimization Problem - find all solution pick the best one - find the max or min of something)
        - Kadanes
        - Knapsack 0/1
        - Knapsack 0/2
    - Monotonic Stack

Optimization Problem:
    - Aim to find the best solution from a set of possible solutions

Backtracking:
    - find all possible solutions
