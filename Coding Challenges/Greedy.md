### When is it used ?
- Optimization Problems: A problem that requires min or max result out of possible solutions

### Under what Context can it be used ?
- If we wanted to construct the most optimal and efficient way to connect a set of cities for a train infrastructure with minimum distance travelled between all cities or minimum distance from one point to another

### What to know ?
- **Minimum Spanning Tree:**
    - If given a weighted graph we want to find no cycles within it (its a tree)
    - and we want to find the minimum distance between each edge 
    - **Algorithms:**
        - Kruskals Algorithm
            - Disjoint Set Union (By Rank)
        - Prims Algorithm
        
- **Dijkstra Algorithm:**
    - Used for find the shortest path from point A to point B
    - Its different from above since it doesn't need to include all edges of a weighted graph like above
