# Arrays

- Hashmap
- 2 Pointers
- Kadanes Algorithm (DP) - Max or Min value at ith index store that -> move to the next index use the max or min of the ith index with the current element OR just use the current element
- Binary Search - Sort the array and then halve it - Basic form logN
- Sorting

- Monotonic Stack:
  - In the stack an order is maintained every time an element is added - i.e. monotonic increasing stack when elements are added or decreasing stack when elements are added (Monotonicall decreasing is bottom of stack is large and top is small - no duplicates)
