## Object Oriented Programming (OOP):

### Class And Objects

- Objects that have variables that can be accessed i.e. properties - store data in some way - complicated combination of various data or just basic data like a Tree
- Objects also have methods to do calculations and change the internal state of the variable
- These classes are instantiated and a instance of a class is created
- Class User - with multiple unique users with similar functionality

- Code Reuse, Scalability

### Encapsulation

- Hiding the variables defined within a class - private - having getters/setters
- The methods are public - only a small subset of the object is available to be used
- Hiding any information through public private functionality

### Polymorphism

- Extends a class and overwrites the method - one method multiple forms - using interface
- implement implements the interface
- extend extends a class and may override the method behavior

### Inheritance

- Extend is used to inherit methods of the parent class
- You can override - see above

### Abstraction

- Hiding implementation details as opposed to information about the object
- creating a function that doers X without the knowledge of the parent function is called abstraction
