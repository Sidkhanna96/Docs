    - I find higher level decision be analytical but when it comes down to minor options be emotional and go with what you want and how you want to live
    - timebox and make decisions quick - Make an absolute decision though!
  - Be okay with not making perfect decision - what doesn't kill you makes you stronger - the bad experiences will make your skin tougher the life experiences will make you tougher than just claiming you've thick skin - Deal with problems believe in yourself you can figure it out
